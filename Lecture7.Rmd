## Puzzle(s) for Today

*Overseas investment tops about $5 trillion a year. What's happening here and why is this international political economy?*

## Why Invest Overseas, and How?
### How and Why Do People Invest Overseas?

There are generally two types of foreign investments: portfolio and direct.

- Portfolio: simple investment with no management input.
    - Sovereign lending constitutes a big chunk of portfolio investment.
- Foreign direct investment (FDI): direct investors maintain managerial control over foreign operation.
    - Think of a BMW plant in Spartanburg, SC, or Michelin plant in Greenville, SC.

## Why Invest Overseas, and How?

<br>

Simple: profit, and a higher rate of return.

- Countries lacking in capital will pay a higher interest for capital investments.
- Ability to invest in resources not available in home/capital-rich country.
- Certainly differences in business environment matter too.

## The Risks of Foreign Investment

<br>
Foreign investment brings a unique risk separate from domestic investment.

<br>

- Sovereign risk: more difficult to enforce debt collection in a foreign jurisdiction.
- Foreign investors don't enjoy the same rights as national borrowers.

---

## Why Borrow?

Borrowing is usually quite popular within borrowing countries, at least early.

- More capital = cheaper to borrow.
- Allows for more government spending without taxation.

However, that ends when it's time to pay up.

- Governments usually service their debts through unpopular austerity measures.

---

## So What's the Problem?

Borrowing is contentious largely because of the **moral hazard**.

- i.e. banks view their profits as private and expect their losses to become public.

This certainly explains Wall Street's line of thinking.

##Multinational Corporations (MNCs)

MNCs constitute one of the major institutional players in international finance. Types of FDI:

- Greenfield: build a new factory from the ground up (e.g. Michelin in South Carolina)
- Mergers and acquisitions (e.g. Anheuser-Busch InBev)
- Joint ventures (i.e. shared ownership)

---

## Why Do MNCs Invest Abroad?

Again, simple: profit, and a higher rate of return.

- Minimize factor costs and search for low-labor.
- Take advantage of permissive tax environments
- Take advantage of supply chains that are simply unavailable
    - i.e. good luck getting an iPhone produced in the U.S.

## Problems of MNC Investment

MNCs generate profit and economic activity is good. But:

- Not a development panacea.
- Capital is more mobile than labor.
- Related problem of immigration.

Further, FDI is not well-regulated at the international level like trade is.
