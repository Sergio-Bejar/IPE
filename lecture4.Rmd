# In this lecture we will learn about:

The Comparative Advantage Model (David Ricardo) and Heckscher-Ohlin Models

---
# Comparative Advantage

Let's go to Ricardo's famous model on the benefits of free trade.

<br>

- Assume only two countries: England and Spain.
- Assume just two goods (of identical quality): cloth and wine

<br>

For simplicity's sake, let's reduce measurements to work-hours for one "unit."

---
<br>

<br>

| **Country** | **Work-Hours for Cloth** | **Work-Hours for Wine** |
|:--------|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| *England* | 100 | 120 |
| *Spain* | 90 | 80 |

Table: Hours of Work Necessary to Produce One Unit (Ricardo's Example)

# Absolute and Comparative Advantage

Notice: Spain is the more efficient country.

<br>

- It requires fewer hours to produce cloth (90 to 100)
- It requires fewer hours to produce wine (80 to 120)

<br>

We say Spain has an **absolute advantage** over England in the production of both.

---
# Absolute and Comparative Advantage

However, England has unique advantage in the production of cloth.

<br>

- 100 work-hours gets England a unit of cloth of 5/6ths a unit of wine.
- 90 work-hours gets Spain a unit of cloth and 1 and 1/8ths a unit of wine.

<br>

Spain has an absolute advantage (i.e. fewer work-hours) but England has a **comparative advantage** (i.e. a lower opportunity cost).
---

# Why Not Specialize and Trade?

Under **autarky** (i.e. absence of trade), 220 (170) total work-hours gets England (Spain) a unit of each. However:

- Spain is more efficient at producing wine than cloth.
- England is more efficient at producing cloth than wine.

If they were to specialize in their comparative advantages:

- Spain could produce 2.125 units of wine.
- England could produce 2.2 units of cloth.

If they were to liberalize their trade, both would produce and consume more of both than they could under autarky.

# A Difficult "Sell"

Economic logic stood at odds with mercantilist policies.

- Government policies that reduce imports compromise efficiency.
- Exports are fine but they're not the only metric for evaluating trade.

<br>

Indeed: *imports are the gains from trade while exports are its costs.*
- Imports allow countries to focus production on its strengths.
- *Remember this the next time you hear some politician talk about the "trade deficit."*

---
# Heckscher-Ohlin Trade Theory

A country will export goods that make intensive use of the factors of production in which it is well-endowed. Factors include:

<br>

- Land (essential to agriculture)
- Labor (usually: unskilled labor)
- Capital (referring to machinery and financial assets to operate machinery)
- Human capital (skilled labor)
---
# Heckscher-Ohlin Trade Theory

Example of countries exporting what they're good at:

<br>

- 19th century U.S. (tobacco, cotton, wheat)
- Current U.S. (capital-intensive machinery)
- Bangladesh (huge low-skilled labor population)
