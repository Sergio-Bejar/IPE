# Sugar Protectionism in the U.S.

Sugar beet and sugarcane farms account for about 1/5 of 1% of U.S. farms.

* Sugar itself accounts for about 1.3% of all farm and livestock production.

<br> 

Yet:

* Sugar is about 33% of all campaign donations from the crop industry.
* Also about 40% of all industry lobbying expenditures. 

<br>

* Import limits stem from 1934 Sugar Act (they were supposed to be temporary).
* Later extended in 1977 and 2002.

# Effects of Sugar Protectionism

The effects of sugar protectionism are not only multiple but usually pretty bad. 

<br>

* Americans have paid, on average, 80% more for raw sugar and 86% more for refined sugar than the rest of the world. 

* Extends to all states and territories (Hawaii and Puerto Rico suffer badly).

* A major (and subtle) effect is substitutions for high-fructose corn syrup which is ridiculously cheap.   Obesity and other chronic diseases are the result.  

<br>

We'd be better off by trading sugar freely without coddling the sugar indystry.

# What's so good about trade?

One word: everything!

# Why Trade?

For producers:

- Sell to new markets, expand business
- Increase efficiency

For consumers:

- Cheaper, more varied goods
    - Seriously, don't pretend like you don't shop at Walmart...
    
For people like me:

- IR scholars have found a robust connection between trade and peace.
- More interconnected states are less likely to fight.

# Why Trade?

(Free) trade follows specialization and division of labor.
