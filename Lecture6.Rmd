## How Do Countries Get What They Want in Trade?

<br>

Trade protectionism is largely driven by domestic concerns.

- Certainly countries can open or close their borders regardless of the action of others.

Still: trade is fundamentally a strategic problem.

- Countries condition mutually beneficial trade based on reciprocity from others.
---
## The Strategic Problems of Trade

Strategic problems in trade resemble a prisoner's dilemma though applications are specific.

- Tit-for-tat tariffs
- Credible commitment problems
    - These are routinely disguised as regulatory barriers
- Dumping (exporting at a price below the normal price)

---
## Overcoming Problems of Strategic Interaction

There are generally four ways to overcome the prisoner's dilemma in trade.

1. Small-numbers
2. Information
3. Repeated interaction
4. Linkage politics

---
## Small-Numbers

Coordination problems and free-riding follows large groups.

- Monitoring is costly.
- States have an incentive to cheat but get the benefit anyway.

Monitoring and enforcement are easier in small numbers.

- e.g. NAFTA, Mercosur

---
## Information

Prisoners "defect" in the prisoner's dilemma because information is concealed. That's less true in trade.

- Common knowledge makes states more likely to cooperate.

---
## Repeated Interaction

Cooperation becomes more likely in repeated interactions.

- Again: recall the implications of the prisoner's dilemma.

Repeated interaction also ameliorates information problem.
---
## Linkage Politics

Trade, like any policy, creates winners and losers.

- States might "give" in one area to "get" in another.

## The Importance of Institutions
### 

![Institutions, like the WTO, are systematic attempts to provide order to trade policy](https://github.com/Sergio-Bejar/IPE/blob/main/figures/WTO.png?raw=true)
---
## The Importance of Institutions

Generally, institutions facilitate trade through two mechanisms

- Reciprocity (explicit or implicit)
- Most-favored nation status

### World Trade Organization

The most important IGO for trade.

- Grew From GATT (one of the original BWIs from 1947)

WTO facilitates negotiations among trading partners through "rounds" based on the norm of reciprocity.

- Basically: to balance out dollar-value of concessions.
- Also facilitates dispute resolution (Dispute Settlement Body) and, importantly, information (i.e. states are compelled to report trade-restriction initiatives).

Fun fact: the U.S. is the most frequent defendant in the WTO despite being its most enthusiastic supporter.

- The U.S. usually honors its defeats based on its value for long-term cooperation.
