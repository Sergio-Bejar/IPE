**Main Economic Principles:**

<br>

- Division of Classes: Workers (labor) vs. Capitalists (Capital)

<br>

- Workers are the majority so they should own production 


<br>

- Heavy involment of the state aparatus (i.e. government in the economy)

Marx actually believed that capitalism can create economic development.

# Dependency Theory (Raul Prebisch)

**It explains underdevelopment as follows:**

- Poor countries produce primary goods and export them to rich countries

- Rich countries produce manufactured goods with those primary goods which are sold back (with and "added value") to poor countries

- The "unfair" trade creates never ending underdevelopment in poor countries

]

The solution according to DT: poorer countries should embark on programs of **import substitution** so that they need not purchase the manufactured products from the richer countries. The poorer countries would still sell their primary products on the world market, but will not purchase manufactured goods from abroad.
