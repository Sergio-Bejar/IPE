##Why Countries Put Up Barriers to Trade? 

We know (hopefully) by now that the world is more interconnected now than even before.  Free trade today is the norm. 

- But this really is an exeption, not the historical rule. 

<br>

Countries have used/still use various tools to redice imports:

- Tariffs 
- Quantitative restrictions (i.e. quotas)
- Non-tarif barriers (e.g. regulations)
---
## Historical Patterns

<br>

Openness to trade has varied substantially over time.

- Over 300 years of mercantilism after the discovery of the Americas.
- Increase in trade followed height of Pax Britannica.
    - U.S. was noteworthy exception here.
- World wars and the Great Depression made protectionism the norm again.

<br>

One such reason why the U.S. has led the charge for liberalizing trade worldwide.

## Why Do Countries Put Up Barriers to Trade?

<br>

Domestic politics, really.

<br>

- Free trade creates diffuse benefits but sometimes concentrates costs.
---
## Who Benefits from Protectionism?

<br>

- National producers
- Scarce factors (see: **Stolper-Samuelson Theorem**)
- Specific industries (see: **Ricardo-Viner Theorem**)
---
## Stolper-Samuelson Theorem

<br>
Within the H-O framework.  The Stolper-Samuelson Theorem describes the relationship between relative prices of output and relative facto rewards (think of real wages and return to capital).

<br>

Specifically, the SS suggests that:
- An increase in the price of the capital-intensive good increases the return to capital and decreases the return to the other factor (labor).
- Likewise, an increase in the price of the labor-intensive good increases wage and reduces rent.

## Who Loses from Protectionism?

<br>

- You
- Also: exporters (who fear reprisal)

# Conclusion

*Free trade is good*.

- Free trade follows logic of comparative advantage.
- It creates abundance unavailable under autarky/mercantilist policies.
- *Imports are actually gains from trade, and not losses*.

However, trade, like any policy, creates winners and losers.

- Problem: benefits are diffuse but costs can be concentrated.
- Protectionism is a public bad, but it's more the norm than free trade (historically).
