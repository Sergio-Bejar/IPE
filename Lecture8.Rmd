## Stages of Financial Crises in Developing Countries 

### Stage 1: Initiation

**Path one: mismanagement of financial liberalization**
- Weak supervision and lack of expertise.
- Domestic banks borrow from foreign banks. 
- Fixed exchange rates give a sense of lower risk.
- Securities markets not well-developed.

**Path two: severe fiscal imbalances**
- Governments force banks to buy government debt. 
- When government debt loses value, bank net worth down . 
- Additional factors:
- Increase in interest rates (from abroad)
- Asset price decrease
- Uncertainty linked to unstable political systems

### Stage 3: Full-Fledged Financial Crisis

- The debt burden in terms if domestic currency increases.
- Banks are more likely to fail if: (1) individuals are less able to play of their debts, and (2) debt denominated in foreign currency increases (i.e. value of liabilities increases).

- Routinely, ordinary citizens bear the costs of adjustment.
