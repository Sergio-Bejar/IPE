# Sugar Protectionism in the U.S.

Sugar beet and sugarcane farms account for about 1/5 of 1% of U.S. farms.

* Sugar itself accounts for about 1.3% of all farm and livestock production.

<br> 

Yet:

* Sugar is about 33% of all campaign donations from the crop industry.
* Also about 40% of all industry lobbying expenditures. 

<br>

* Import limits stem from 1934 Sugar Act (they were supposed to be temporary).
* Later extended in 1977 and 2002.

Karl Mark (1818-1883).

<br>
**Main Economic Principles:**

<br>

- Division of Classes: Workers (labor) vs. Capitalists (Capital)

<br>

- Workers are the majority so they should own production 


<br>

- Heavy involment of the state aparatus (i.e. government in the economy)

]

Marx actually believed that capitalism can create economic development.

**It explains underdevelopment as follows:**

- Poor countries produce primary goods and export them to rich countries

- Rich countries produce manufactured goods with those primary goods which are sold back (with and "added value") to poor countries

- The "unfair" trade creates never ending underdevelopment in poor countries

]

The solution according to DT: poorer countries should embark on programs of **import substitution** so that they need not purchase the manufactured products from the richer countries. The poorer countries would still sell their primary products on the world market, but will not purchase manufactured goods from abroad.
